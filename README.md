# Some kind of camera/galvo based laser harp

## Resources

### Openlase

So far the pattern is generated by openlase, cool but old and needs some love, but will contain some good inspiration.

#### Download/Make/Build/Install

#### Setup jack for software audio routing

## Progress

`/Python` Contains the music harmonic/interval generation "modules"

`/CV` Was probably the start of playing around with opencv, not sure what's in there

Proper vision progress can be found here: https://github.com/carebare47/opencv_laser_harp - Currently thresholds the laser in a rotated colour space very effectively, and stabilises the flickering of the galvos without adding too much latency (via PS3 eye camera)

## To do

### Electronics

		* Bypass AC output caps so DAC can drive laser(s) at DC
		* DAC is single rail so, with caps bypassed zero will drift up to 2.5v, find 2.5v reference to feed to differential amp
		* Galvo takes differential input, could try and hook it across and see if I can increase the galvo gains, but ideally we want a 2.5x op-amp in between them


### Software

		* Dots already projected and masked/thresholded, now to figure out which one has been hidden and trigger a note
